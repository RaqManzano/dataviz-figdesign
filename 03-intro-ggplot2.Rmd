# Visualising data in R

<img src="img/ggplot2.png" width="50"/>

Visualising is probably one of the most satisfying parts of doing data analysis. After all, who doesn't like a nice plot? In tidyverse plotting is made very easy for us, using the **`ggplot2`** package.
`ggplot2` is a very popular package used for plotting mainly due to its simple, modular way to create plots from tabular data and with it, you can easily create plots like this:

```{r ggplot-example, purl = FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>% drop_na()

survey_recent <- surveys_complete %>%
                  select(species_id, weight, hindfoot_length, year, sex) %>%
                  filter(year >= 1995)
                  
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(data = surveys_complete) +
  geom_point(data = survey_recent, colour = "red", alpha = 0.4)
```

So how do we create such plots? Well, however complicated a plot is, the basic syntax that `ggplot` uses remains the same:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```
As you can see there are 3 main elements that you need to create a plot:

The `ggplot` function takes 2 arguments:

* **data**: This is the data frame to attach to the plot.  The data frame must contain the variables to plot as columns and the rows must contain the observations that you need to plot.
* **mapping**: Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties of the plot.  

Using the `ggplot` function on its own will not plot anything. We need to add a **geom_function** as a layer. Layers are added to plots by using `+`.  They are added on top of the other previous layers that might be present.    

* **geom_function**: This specifies the type of plot would you like to plot.  The greatest advantage of this is that you can easily change the plot type by just changing the geom_function and keeping everything else the same.  You can see a whole list of plots that you can plot  [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html#section-layer-geoms).

Let's practice this on our `surveys` data set. We would like to create a scatter plot with `weight` on the x-axis, `hindfoot_length` on the y-axis:

```{r ggplot-empty}
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
```

<br />

## Adding layers

As you can see if you just specify the `ggplot` function with the data and aesthetic mappings, it will create a plot, but the data itself is not displayed.  Let us now add the `geom_function` for the scatter plot (`geom_point()`) as a layer to the plot:

```{r ggplot-scatterplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, purl = FALSE}
ggplot(data = surveys, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point()
```

You can customise some of the visualisations of the plot to extract more information from it.  For instance, we can add some transparency (`alpha`) to avoid over plotting. The `alpha` takes values from 0 (100% transparency) to 1 (0% transparency):

```{r adding-transparency, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = surveys,
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

You can find a list of aesthetics for each type of plot in the [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).  

We can also add colours for all the points by adding the `colour` argument to the geom.

```{r adding-colours, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = surveys,
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(colour = "blue")
```

Another way of colouring data points is **based on a variable**. For example, if we were interested to see which data points belong to each plot type - to see if there is any pattern in the data - then we could give each plot type its own colour. The way to specify this is in the `aes()` helper function, where we give the `colour` argument the relevant variable (i.e. the name of the column in our data set that contains this variable).

```{r adding-colours-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = surveys,
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, colour = plot_type)) +
    geom_point()
```

:::note
**Colour within `aes()` or not?**

It might be a bit confusing where the `colour` argument needs to go. When we were colouring all the data points blue it went in the `geom_point()` and not within an `aes()`, whereas when we were colouring based on `plot_type` it had to go inside the `aes()`. An easy way to remember what to use is: _If the colour is based on the data, then it goes inside `aes()`, otherwise it does not._
:::

If we would like to try other type of plots on the data, the best thing is to save the ggplot into a variable as below:

```{r ggplot-assigning, fig.show="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Assign plot to a variable
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys, 
                       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

# Draw a scatter plot
surveys_plot + 
    geom_point()
```

As you can see, when we assigned the plot to `surveys_plot` we did not specify a `geom_function`. That is because if we store the plot backbone into a variable, we can then easily add the `geom_function` we are interested in, without having to type all the initial plot data again.

Now let's draw a `geom_smooth` plot.  This plot is good when you need to see if there is any pattern between the two variables being plotted that you would not normally see in a scatter plot due to over plotting.

```{r ggplot-smooth, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
surveys_plot +
    geom_smooth()
```

Rather than seeing each plot separately, sometimes plotting multiple plots on top of each other is a better way. You can add multiple plots as layers on top of each other as follows:

```{r ggplot-multiple-layers, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
surveys_plot +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

:::note
**Argument inheritance in plots**

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (_i.e.,_ these are universal plot settings). 
- You can also specify mappings for a given geom independently of the mappings defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line containing the *previous* layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added at the beginning of the line containing the new layer, >**`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

```{r ggplot-layer-syntax, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
surveys_plot +
  geom_point()

# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
surveys_plot 
  + geom_point()
```

:::exercise
Scatter plots can be useful exploratory tools for small data sets. For data sets with large numbers of observations, such as the `surveys` data set, over plotting of points can be a limitation of scatter plots. We have already seen how we can visualise data better when we have over-plotting with the `geom_smooth` plot. Another way for handling over-plotting is to display the density of the data through contours. This is handled by the `geom_density` geometry. For this challenge do the following:

1. Create a script called `plot_density2d.R`
2. In this script, load the data from `data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv` into a variable `surveys`.
3. Using `ggplot`, plot the `weight` on the x-axis and `hindfoot_length` on the y-axis in and create a `geom_density2d` plot.

```{r ggplot-exercise-density, fig.show="hide", answer=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load the surveys data
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
 
# Attach data and map x and y axes
surveys_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys, 
                       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
# Draw geom_density2d
surveys_plot +
  geom_density2d()
```

## Facets

We have seen that we can highlight parts of our data by using colour. For example, we used `colour = plot_type` to colour our data based by plot type to see if there are any trends in the data.

Another way of highlighting parts of the data is by splitting the data into separate panels, based on a variable within your data. This is called **faceting** and it is a very powerful tool in `ggplot` to better understand your data.

There are two types of facet functions:

* `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to fit on one page.
* `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels.
Both geometries allow to to specify faceting variables specified with `vars()`.

In general:

* `facet_wrap(facets = vars(facet_variable))`
* `facet_grid(rows = vars(row_variable), cols = vars(col_variable))`.

For example, if we want to visualise the scatter plot above split by `plot_type`:

```{r facet-wrap, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(plot_type))
```

If instead we want a matrix of facets to display the data based on two variables, such as `plot_type` and `sex`, then we use `facet_grid()`:

```{r facet-grid, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex), cols = vars(plot_type))
```
  
Finally, with `facet_grid()`, you can organise the panels just by rows or just by columns. Try running this code yourself:

```{r facet-manual, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# One column, facet by rows
ggplot(surveys, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex))

# One row, facet by column
ggplot(surveys, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(sex))
```

## Saving a plot to a file {#saveplot}

Saving a plot is something you will want to do often. Fortunately it is quite easy to do this with `tidyverse`.

To save a plot to file we use the `ggsave` function.  If you look at the [documentation of ggsave](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html) you can see the different arguments the `ggsave` function takes.  Let's save the plot present in the `surveys_plot` variable into a file called `plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png` and place this into the `img_output` folder within our working directory (check that it is present, if not you need to create it).  

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Save plot that you would like to save into a variable
out_plot <- surveys_plot + geom_density2d()
# Save plot to file
ggsave(filename = "img_output/plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png", plot = out_plot)
```

<br />

:::note
You do not necessarily need to save the plot into a variable before saving it to file.  If you do not specify the `plot` argument in the `ggsave` function, `ggsave` will take the last plot that you plotted and save it into the `filename` specified.

```{r ggsave-directly, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Save plot to file
ggsave(filename = "img_output/plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png")
```

Alternatively, you can go to the Plots pane and click on the **Export** button. This can be easy if you quickly want to share a plot, but it does mean that it is not reproducible. So if you want other people to recreate your work, then always use code to save your plots!
