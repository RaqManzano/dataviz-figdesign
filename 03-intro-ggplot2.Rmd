Visualising is probably one of the most satisfying parts of doing data analysis. After all, who doesn't like a nice plot? We have already seen the basic syntax to create a `ggplot()`:

```
ggplot(data = <DATA>, mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>)) +  <GEOM_FUNCTION>()
```

and with it, you can create plots such as this:

```{r ggplot-example, purl = FALSE, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
surveys %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  mutate(recent = year >= 2000) %>% 
  arrange(recent) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = recent)) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("black", "firebrick")) +
  labs(x = "Weight (g)", y = "Hindfoot Length (cm)", 
       colour = "Collected after 1995")
```

Make sure you loaded the surveys data:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
surveys <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
```

For this lesson we’re going to remove missing values from our table. 
This is not always desirable (you might be throwing away good data!), but it will help us make this lesson clearer.

We will use the function `drop_na()`, which removes rows with any missing data:

```{r}
surveys_complete <- surveys %>% drop_na()
```


## Customising Geometries

Plots creating with `ggplot()` are extremely versatile - you can change any component of the plot, whether it is the data points, the axes, the titles, the ticks on the axes etc. Some of these custom options you will want to use often, whilst others are perhaps less relevant. There are too many options to cover all of them, but we will go through some of the most useful ones.

Geometries themselves can be changed in several ways, for example their transparency, 
colour, size, shape, etc. 

To know which _aesthetic_ components can be changed in a particular geometry, 
look at its documentation (e.g. `?geom_point`) and look under the "Aesthetics" section 
of the help page. For example, the documentation for `?geom_point` says:

> geom_point() understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in bold):
> - **x**
> - **y**
> - alpha
> - colour
> - fill
> - group
> - shape
> - size
> - stroke

You can also find a list of aesthetics for each type of plot in the [ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf).  

For example, we can use the `alpha` aesthetic to change the transparence of the points. 
This is very useful when your data points are really close together, or even overlapping. 
The `alpha` argument takes values from 0 (100% transparency) to 1 (0% transparency):

```{r adding-transparency, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.2)
```

```{r adding-colours, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}

       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
    geom_point(colour = "blue", shape = 6, size = 3)
```

</details>

:::


### Changing aesthetics based on data

Another way of modifying geometries is **based on a variable**. 
For example, if we were interested to see which data points belong to each plot type - to see if there is any pattern in the data - then we could give each plot type its own colour. 
The way to specify this is in the `aes()` helper function, where we give the `colour` argument the relevant variable (i.e. the name of the column in our data set that contains this variable).

```{r adding-colours-data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show=TRUE}
ggplot(data = surveys_complete,
       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length, colour = plot_type)) +
    geom_point()
```

:::note
**Aesthetics: within `aes()` or not?**

It might be a bit confusing where the `colour`/`size`/`alpha`/etc. arguments need to go. 
For example, when we were colouring all the data points blue in the previous exercise, it went in the `geom_point()` and not within an `aes()`, whereas when we were colouring based on `plot_type` it had to go inside the `aes()`. 
An easy way to remember what to use is: **if we want the aesthetic to change based on the data, then it goes inside `aes()`, otherwise it does not**.

## Same data different plots

If we would like to try other type of plots on the data, one option is to save the ggplot into a variable as below:

```{r ggplot-assigning, fig.show="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Assign plot to a variable
surveys_complete_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete, 
                       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))

# Draw a scatter plot
surveys_complete_plot + 
    geom_point()
```

As you can see, when we assigned the plot to `surveys_complete_plot` we did not specify a `geom_function`. That is because if we store the plot backbone into a variable, we can then easily add the `geom_function` we are interested in, without having to type all the initial plot data again.

Now let's use a `geom_smooth()` instead of `geom_point()`.  This geometry is good when you need to see if there is any pattern between the two variables being plotted that you would not normally see in a scatter plot due to over plotting.

```{r ggplot-smooth, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
surveys_complete_plot +
    geom_smooth()
```

Rather than seeing each geometry separately, sometimes plotting multiple geometries on top of each other is a better way. You can add multiple plots as layers on top of each other as follows:

```{r ggplot-multiple-layers, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
surveys_complete_plot +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
```

:::note
**Argument inheritance in plots**

- Anything you put in the `ggplot()` function can be seen by any geom layers that you add (_i.e.,_ these are universal plot settings). 
- You can also specify mappings for a given geom independently of the mappings defined globally in the `ggplot()` function.
- The `+` sign used to add new layers must be placed at the end of the line containing the *previous* layer. If, instead, the `+` sign is added at the beginning of the line containing the new layer, >**`ggplot2`** will not add the new layer and will return an error message.

```{r ggplot-layer-syntax, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
# This is the correct syntax for adding layers
surveys_complete_plot +
  geom_point()

# This will not add the new layer and will return an error message
surveys_complete_plot 
  + geom_point()
```

:::exercise

Make a _boxplot_ of `genus` (x-axis) by `hindfoot_length` (y-axis). 
Add a new geometry layer _behind_ the boxplot using `geom_violin()`.

Bonus: either by doing a web-search or by looking at the help page of `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()`, see if you can find how you can scale the violins so that they all have the same width and make the width of the boxplots smaller.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

The basic plot is:

```{r}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(genus, weight)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot()
```

However, the boxplots offuscate the violin plots. 
Looking at the help for `geom_boxplot()` and `geom_violin()`, we can see there are some options to change this behaviour. 

```{r}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(genus, weight)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
```

### Exercise - geom_density2d

Scatter plots can be useful exploratory tools for small data sets. For data sets with large numbers of observations, such as the `surveys_complete` data set, over plotting of points can be a limitation of scatter plots. We have already seen how we can visualise data better when we have over-plotting by adding transparency to our points. Another way for handling over-plotting is to display the density of the data through contours. This is handled by the `geom_density()` geometry. 

1. Create a script called `plot_density2d.R`
2. In this script, load the data from `data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv` into a variable `surveys_complete`.
3. Using `ggplot`, plot the `weight` on the x-axis and `hindfoot_length` on the y-axis in and create a `geom_density2d` plot.

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r ggplot-exercise-density, fig.show="hide", answer=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Load the surveys_complete data
surveys_complete <- read_csv("data_raw/portal_data_joined.csv")
 
# Attach data and map x and y axes
surveys_complete_plot <- ggplot(data = surveys_complete, 
                       mapping = aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length))
# Draw geom_density2d
surveys_complete_plot +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_density2d()
```

## Controlling aesthetics in individual geometries

Let’s say that, in the plot from our previous exercise, we wanted to colour the violins by genus, but keep the boxplots without colour.

As we’ve learned, because we want to colour our geometries based on data, this goes inside the aes() part of the graph:

```{r}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = genus, y = weight, fill = genus)) +
  geom_violin(scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
```

OK, this is not what we wanted. Both geometries (boxplots and violins) got coloured.

It turns out that we can control aesthetics individually in each geometry, using the aes() function. Like this:

```{r}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = genus), scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2)
```


:::exercise

Modify the graph above by colouring the inside of the boxplots by genus and the inside of the violins in grey colour.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "grey", scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = genus), width = 0.2)
```

<details><summary>Answer</summary>

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, aes(x = genus, y = weight)) +
  geom_violin(fill = "grey", scale = "width") +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = genus), width = 0.2)
```

## Facets

We have seen that we can highlight parts of our data by using colour. For example, we used `colour = plot_type` to colour our data based by plot type to see if there are any trends in the data.

Another way of highlighting parts of the data is by splitting the data into separate panels, based on a variable within your data. This is called **faceting** and it is a very powerful tool in `ggplot` to better understand your data.

There are two types of facet functions:

* `facet_wrap()` arranges a one-dimensional sequence of panels to fit on one page.
* `facet_grid()` allows you to form a matrix of rows and columns of panels.
Both geometries allow to to specify faceting variables specified with `vars()`.

In general:

* `facet_wrap(facets = vars(facet_variable))`
* `facet_grid(rows = vars(row_variable), cols = vars(col_variable))`.

<br>

### Using `facet_wrap()`
If we wanted to visualise the scatter plot we created above, but split by `plot_type` we would have to use `facet_wrap()`, since we are splitting the data by one variable (`plot_type`):

```{r facet-wrap, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(facets = vars(plot_type))
```

<br>

### Using `facet_grid`
What if we wanted to split the data by `plot_type`, but also further divide the data by `sex` to see if there are any clear differences between male and female observations? In that case we would have to split the data based on _two_ variables, which means we have to use `facet_grid()`:

```{r facet-grid, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(surveys_complete, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex), cols = vars(plot_type))
```
  
Finally, with `facet_grid()`, you can organise the panels just by rows or just by columns. Try running this code yourself:

```{r facet-manual, warning=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# One column, facet by rows
ggplot(surveys_complete, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(rows = vars(sex))

# One row, facet by column
ggplot(surveys_complete, 
       aes(x = weight, y = hindfoot_length)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_grid(cols = vars(sex))
```

## Saving a plot to a file {#saveplot}

Saving a plot is something you will want to do often. Fortunately it is quite easy to do this with `tidyverse`.

To save a plot to file we use the `ggsave` function.  If you look at the [documentation of ggsave](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsave.html) you can see the different arguments the `ggsave` function takes.  Let's save the plot present in the `surveys_complete_plot` variable into a file called `plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png` and place this into the `img_output` folder within our working directory (check that it is present, if not you need to create it).  

```{r ggsave, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Save plot that you would like to save into a variable
out_plot <- surveys_complete_plot + geom_density2d()
# Save plot to file
ggsave(filename = "img_output/plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png", plot = out_plot)
```

<br>

:::note
You do not necessarily need to save the plot into a variable before saving it to file.  If you do not specify the `plot` argument in the `ggsave` function, `ggsave` will take the last plot that you plotted and save it into the `filename` specified.

```{r ggsave-directly, eval=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# Save plot to file
ggsave(filename = "img_output/plot_weight_hindfoot_density2d.png")
```

Alternatively, you can go to the Plots pane and click on the **Export** button. This can be easy if you quickly want to share a plot, but it does mean that it is not reproducible. So if you want other people to recreate your work, then always use code to save your plots!
